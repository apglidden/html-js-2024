                <p><b>Andrew Glidden</b> <i>Feburary 16th, 2024</i></p>
                <p><i>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</i> is my favorite movie because I have always loved the Harry Potter franchise growing up. This particular movie in the set was the best in my opinion because I loved some of the backstory behind Professor Snape's past as the story revealed he was the half blood prince. The unique spellwork and potions that were in Snape's book was very cool to see and I love how frustrated Harry made his friends by using some of his young professor's cheat to get a leg up in class. I watched this entire series at least three times when I was a kid but I always remember watching this one an extra fourth or fifth time.</p>

                <p>I'd have to say my favorite actor in this movie is Alan Rickman who played Professor Snape. Snape was always one of my favorite characters throughout the Haryr Potter universe because he was designed to be that character everyone hated, despite being one of the purest and most important person in the entire plot.</p>

                <p>Also there's magic so what could be better than that?</p>
